# DAO configuration

After a DAO is created, users that detain governance tokens or council tokens can change the DAO configuration.

<Callout type="error" emoji="🚨">
For safe measures against DAO attacks make sure you DAO configuration has a **high minimum of governance tokens** for it to be altered.
</Callout>

## Initial Config Visualisation

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
**Dean's List Network State DAO** is used below for example purposes.
</Callout>

After a DAO is deployed the configuration of a DAO can be found in **`Params`**. 

![](../source/createadao/daoconfig_step1.png)

### Parameters

Upon opening **`Params`** you will find the DAO main addresses, configuration & governances (treasuries).

![](../source/createadao/daoconfig_step3.png)

### Addresses

In the addresses section users are able to see:

* **Pubkey**: Address of the DAO 
* **Authority 'x DAO Treasury'**: Realm authority, usually set to one of the DAO wallets, the authority controls DAO configuration.
* **Owner 'Governance Program'**: spl-governance instance used by the DAO.
* **Community Mint**: Address of the chosen governance token.
* **Council Mint**: Address of the council token.

### Config

In the config section users are able to see:
* **Community max vote weight source**: Percentage of the token supply considered for quorum or absolute number of the token supply or set number by the DAO.
* **Min community tokens to create governance**: It is what it says.
<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
For **Multisig DAOs** without the community governance token, this value is irrelevant and it's defaulted to an arbitrary number of **1,000,000**.
</Callout>
* **Use community voter weight add-in**: Indicates whether voter weight governance plugin is used by the DAO.
* **Use max community voter weight add-in**: Indicates whether max voter weight governance plugin is used by the DAO.

### Governance (Treasuries)

In the governances section users are able to see the DAO treasury/ treasuries and their parameters, accounts & statistics.

For every treasury created an authority is also given for each.

## Config Modification

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
Only users with sufficient governance tokens can propose configuration changes to maintain DAO security.
</Callout>

### Prerequisites for Config Changes

Before modifying DAO configuration, ensure you have:

* Sufficient governance tokens to meet the minimum proposal threshold
* Understanding of the proposed changes and their impact
* Community consensus or discussion around the modification

### Proposing Configuration Changes

<Steps>
### Step 1 - Access DAO Configuration

Navigate to your DAO's **Params** section and review the current configuration settings.

### Step 2 - Create Configuration Proposal

Click on **"Create Proposal"** to start proposing configuration changes.

config_modify_step2

### Step 3 - Select Configuration Type

Choose the type of configuration you want to modify:

* **Community Vote Threshold**: Minimum tokens required for governance participation
* **Council Configuration**: Changes to council structure and requirements
* **Voting Parameters**: Quorum requirements, voting periods, and approval thresholds
* **Treasury Settings**: Treasury management and spending limits

### Step 4 - Configure New Parameters

Enter the new configuration values carefully. Each parameter change requires:

* **Current Value**: Display of existing configuration
* **New Value**: Your proposed changes
* **Justification**: Explanation for the modification

### Step 5 - Review and Submit

Review your proposed changes thoroughly before submission. Include:

* **Change Summary**: Brief description of modifications
* **Impact Analysis**: How changes affect DAO operations
* **Implementation Timeline**: When changes take effect

### Step 6 - Community Voting

After submission, the proposal enters the voting phase where:

* DAO members vote on the proposed changes
* Voting period follows DAO governance rules
* Proposal requires majority approval to pass

config_modify_step6

### Step 7 - Execute Configuration Changes

Once approved, execute the configuration changes:

* Click **"Execute"** in the proposal's instruction section
* Configuration updates apply immediately
* All DAO members are notified of the changes

</Steps>

### Common Configuration Modifications

#### Adjusting Vote Thresholds

Modify the minimum number of governance tokens required for:
* Creating proposals
* Participating in votes
* Reaching quorum for decisions

#### Council Management

Update council-related settings such as:
* Maximum number of council members
* Council voting weights
* Council election processes

#### Voting Parameters

Configure voting mechanics including:
* Voting duration periods
* Approval percentage requirements
* Quorum thresholds

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
Configuration changes are permanent and affect all future DAO operations. Ensure community consensus before proposing significant modifications.
</Callout>

<Callout type="error" emoji="🚨">
**Security Note**: Always set conservative thresholds to prevent governance attacks. Higher minimum token requirements provide better security against malicious proposals.
